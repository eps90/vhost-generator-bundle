# VHost Generator Bundle

## Library under heavy development! Use it on your own risk!

## TODO:

- **List command** - to list all available vhosts (needs some parser)
- **Disable command** - disable vhosts configured with this application
- **Composer installer** - to make application able to install vhosts on install/update(?)
- **ApacheVhostNode**:
    - logs path properties
